# Project Vylia

### Overview

Project Vylia is a 2D JRPG experimental game engine based in XNA 4.0 Monogame (Visual Studio C# Solution). 
Inspired by Popular Japanese Role Playing Games and RPG Maker, this project aims 
to be a free, flexible and easy to use tool for content creators and game designers.

### Origins

This project started out as a way for myself to learn c# and develop my abilities. 
At this moment, I continue to commit changes on this project as a hobbie.

### Build status

At the moment, the game is pretty much "playable", and features some basic movement functions, along with map, npc and tileset loading (from XML Serialized Classes), and a few basic NPC conversation functions.

### Features

- XML tile map, npc and tileset parser
- Fully functional tilemap render
- Inside "camera" tile rendering
- NPC Actor loader
- NPC Conversation with color support
  * Basic conversation box
  * Binary choice support
  * Conditions support
  * Variable reading/writing support
  * Text fits automatically on conversation container.
- Warp between map support
  
### Documentation

Soon... 

### Libraries

The solution should only need Monogame and Monogame.Extended to work.

### Resources

I'm using 2 tilesets and 2 maps for testing right now.
